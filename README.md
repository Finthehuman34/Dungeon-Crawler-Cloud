**Top-Down Roguelike Game (Unity)**

A solo project created as part of my A-Level Computer Science coursework. Built using Unity (C#), this game demonstrates a full development lifecycle: from research and design to implementation, evaluation, and improvement.

**Features**

- Top-down roguelike gameplay with real-time combat

- Enemies with player tracking and different stats (to add varying levels of difficulty)

- Player movement, health system, and collectible items

- Fully documented design, development, and testing process

**Technologies Used**

- Engine: Unity

- Language: C#

- Version Control: Git / GitHub

- Other Tools: Visual Studio Code

**How to Play**

1. Download the release build from the Releases section.

2. Unzip the folder

3. Run DungeonCrawlerCloud.exe (Windows) or open via Unity Editor

4. Use WASD to move and LMB to attack (Using the direction of your mouse to strike in that direction)

**Development Process**

This project followed a structured software development lifecycle:

- Research: Studied roguelike mechanics and Unity game architecture

- Design: Created design documents, diagrams, and prototypes

- Development: Implemented gameplay systems, AI, and UI in C#

- Testing & Evaluation: Conducted playtesting, documented issues, iterated improvements

**Future Improvements**

- Add multiple weapon types and upgrade system

- Implement procedural level generation

- Introduce more enemy classes with unique behaviors

- Add an item shop so you can spend the gold to buy more weapons and armour
